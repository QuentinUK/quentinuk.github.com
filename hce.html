brought up under a camel act of dynasties
long out of print, the first of Shitric Shilkan<span class="h">-<br></span>beard (or is it Owllaugh MacAuscullpth the
Thord?), but, in pontofacts massimust, I am

Ergastulus, as this is, whether in Farnum’s
rath or Condra’s ridge or the meadows of
Daikin or Monkish tunshep, by saints and
sinners eyeeye alike as a cleanliving man
and, as a matter of fict, by my halfwife, I
think how our public at large appreciates it
most highly from me that I am as clean<span class="hh">-<br></span>living as could be and that my game was a
fair average since I perpetually kept my
ouija ouija wicket up. On my verawife
I never was nor can afford to be guilty of
crim crig con, of malfeasance trespass
against parson with the person of a youthful
gigirl frifrif friend chirped Apples, acted by
Miss Dashe, in Kissilov’s Slutsgartern or
Gigglotte’s Hill, when I would touch to her
dot and feel most greenily of her unripe<a class="p">08

ones as it should prove most anniece and
far too bahad, nieceless to say, to my repu<span class="h">-<br></span>tation on Babbyl Malket for daughters-in<span class="hh">-<br></span>trade being lightly clad. I should her have
awristed under my duskguise of whippers
through toombs and deempeys, lagmen,
was she but tinkling of such a tink. And,
as a mere matter of ficfect, I tell of myself
how I popo possess the ripest littlums wi<span class="h">-<br></span>fukie around the globelettes globes upon
which she was romping off on Floss Mun<span class="h">-<br></span>dai out of haram’s way round Skinner’s cir<span class="h">-<br></span>cusalley first with her consolation prize in
my serial dreams of faire women, Manne<span class="h">-<br></span>quins Passe, handicapped by two breasts in
operatops, a remarkable little endowment
garment. Fastened at various places. What
spurt ! I kickkick keenly love such, par<span class="h">-<br></span><a class="p">09

at their most perfect best when served with
heliotrope ayelips, as this is, where I do
drench my jolly soul on the pu pure beauty
of her past.</p>
<p>She is my bestpreserved wholewife, so<span class="h">-<br></span>well her as herafter, in Evans’s eye, with
incompatibly the smallest shoenumber out<span class="h">-<br></span>side chinatins. They are jolly dainty spekin
tluly. May we not recommend them? It
was my proofpiece from my prentice ser<span class="h">-<br></span>ving. And, alas, our private chaplain of
Lambeyth and Dolekey bishopregionary,
an always sadfaced man, in his lutestring
