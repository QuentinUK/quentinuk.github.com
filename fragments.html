<a class="p" id="pBrancusi"></a></section><section id="preface"><h3>PREFACE</h3><p><span>T</span>HE preservation of Print, the authority of the
Authorised Version, the convenience of
Dr. Johnson’s Dictionary, the standardization of
the English Public Schools, and the exigencies
of Fleet Street. If we are looking for the chief
historical influences which have somewhat over<span class="h">-<br></span>conventionalized the English language, we shall
find it hard to add a sixth of equal significance.
The power of print over simple minds, the clichés 
engendered by doctrines of verbal inspiration, 
the lexicographical rally against the cursory and 
the colloquial, the tyranny of grammatical good 
form, and the scurry of late extras ; all are still
with us. It is not surprising that after five<a class="p" id="pI"></a>
centuries the resentment of those who decline to 
play the game according to the rules of the 
schoolmaster is overt and vocal ; or that Mr. Joyce 
appears as a promised liquidator where the 
machinery of literature has been clogged by the 
ministrations and minutiae of an ossified propæ<span class="h">-<br></span>deutic.</p>
<p>Not that the dissatisfaction is general in the 
literary community. The world of sight and space 
is more sensitive to the new spirit — but the 
academicians are not altering their language to 
accommodate Kandinsky or Brancusi, nor are the 
Todhunters (whose bleak régime once seared a 
romantic Irish soul, as we learn from these pages) 
perturbed by the tensors of the Einsteins. In 
music alone are stirrings heard which may affect 
fundamental notation in the near future ; and, as 
usual, Paris, if not Moscow and New York, has 
been publicly tuning in for a full decade.</p>
<p>Readers, however, who are unsympathetic to 
linguistic experiments, and unfamiliar with the<a class="p" id="pII"></a>
milieu from which these particular experiments 
have emerged, will find themselves at a dis<span class="h">-<br></span>advantage. That such may be encouraged to 
pause for a few moments before allowing their 
impatience a free rein, one whose approach is 
primarily linguistic has been asked to put together 
a few prefatory remarks.</p>
<p>Of the three semi-detached satirical pieces 
here reprinted in a much expanded form, the 
first is from Part I, the second from Part II, and 
the third from Part III, of Mr. Joyce’s forthcoming 
work, the title of which has not yet been disclosed, 
though the eight installments of Part I and nearly 
all of Part III, under the general caption <i>Work in 
Progress</i>, have been made available in <i>transition</i> 
since the appearance of <i>Ulysses</i> in 1922. One other 
such fragment <i>Anna Livia Plurabelle</i> has also 
been accorded independent publication (1928), but 
in order to pass judgment on these isolated gesticul<span class="h">-<br></span>atory specimens something more than sympathy and
good will may be requisite. There is the mental<a class="p" id="pIII"></a>
factor — the ideology of half a lifetime, the
environmental — for James Joyce, though he can
write standard English and lives in Paris, is
neither an Englishman nor a Parisian ; and
the experimental — the factor of symbolic inno<span class="h">-<br></span>vation. Each may be noticed in turn.</p>
<p>The mental factor in the case of Mr. Joyce is 
not more of an obstacle than has been surmounted 
by readers of many of his contemporaries. Thus 
we find such names as Hart Crane, E.E. Cummings, 
Gertrude Stein, Edith Sitwell, and Maiakovsky 
also associated by Max Eastman with the “Cult of 
Unintelligibility” which the critic so urbanely 
deprecates. Mallarmé, Rimbaud, Dodgson, Gerard 
Hopkins, Morgenstern, and T. S. Eliot might be 
instanced with still greater relevance. To the 
barriers which such authors interpose Mr. Joyce 
has added his mediaeval and Jesuit background, 
his origins in Celtic romanticism, his predilection 
for Norse and Classical mythology, a later pre<span class="h">-<br></span>occupation with the <i>Purgatorio</i>, and a final phase<a class="p" id="pIV"></a>
embracing Vico, Freud, and the reactions of The 
Enemy.</p>
<p>Then there is Dublin. Some of us failed to be 
born and bred on the banks of the Liffey and to 
that extent we are at a disadvantage in interpreting 
some of Mr. Joyce’s basic symbols. The disad<span class="h">-<br></span>vantage is probably not greater than that of a 
student at Ann Arbor confronted by Pindar, or 
a member of the Athenaeum endeavouring to 
establish relations with a record by Bessie Smith. 
From over half of every audience at Covent 
Garden or the Metropolitan Opera House less than 
one-quarter of the symbolic material can be 
securing any adhesion. In so far, therefore, as
such audiences are not listening with a purely 
musical or social ear, they are relying on that 
vaguer emotive rapport which in the case of 
Mr. Joyce is equally easily established. His <i>pietas</i> 
is so transparent that the effort required to shoulder 
this load need not be greater than we made in 
our childhood in the interests of old Anchises.<a class="p" id="pV"></a></p>
<p>When, however, we turn from the environ<span class="h">-<br></span>mental to the experimental, there yawns a greater 
gulf. Many who find themselves bored by local 
lore are overcome by absolute inertia when urged 
to the acquisition of new linguistic tricks after the 
age of twenty-one. A few, such as Jane Harrison, 
may master the aspects in Russian when past 
three score, but serious attempts on polysynthetic 
languages are rarer. The case of Eskimo, since 
it may have a more direct bearing on these frag<span class="h">-<br></span>ments than even their author supposes, is worthy 
of special consideration.</p>
<p>We know that Mr. Joyce has conscious mytho<span class="h">-<br></span>logical affiliations with his Norse ancestors; and 
a dexterous “Norsemanship” is occasionally 
evident even in <i>The Mookse</i>. But did the clouds 
he trails condense even farther north ?</p>
<p>The technique of much of Mr. Joyce’s verbal 
creation may be illustrated by the principle of 
the <i>infix</i>. English works almost entirely through 
<i>suffixes</i> and <i>affixes</i>. We even go so far as to<a class="p" id="pVI"></a>
tolerate dis | em | barc | ation officials. But an 
official banquet is not so called because the menu 
comprises fish and offal. The Eskimos, however, 
would find nothing extraordinary in the compound 
off | fish | al. A house agent in Greenland, anxious 
to dispose of a “ large and capacious modern 
residence, built to present owner’s special design 
and still in owner’s occupation ; allowance for 
dilapidations due to the efflux of time and normal 
wear and tear,” etc., would require only one word</p>
<p class="c"><i>Iglupakulia</i></p>
<p>To illustrate the principle of infixes, let us 
consider how this word is constructed. There are 
twenty-seven case forms in Eskimo, nine each in 
the singular, dual, and plural ; and the singular, 
forms of the noun <i>iglu</i> meaning a shelter, such as 
a dwelling, church, station or tent, are as follows :</p>
<p>IGLU (accusative case)</p>
<p>IGLUM (nominative case)</p>
<p class="iglu">IGLUA (genitive case) - one house belonging to
one man<a class="p" id="pVII"></a></p>
<p>IGLUMUN to the house</p>
<p>IGLUMIN from the house</p>
<p>IGLUMI in the house</p>
<p>IGLUMIK with the house</p>
<p>IGLUKUN through the house</p>
<p>IGLUTUN like a house</p>
<p>The word Iglupakulia is built up with the infixes 
PAK, LIK and KUK, which are themselves 
changed to suit the rest of the word. Thus :</p>
<p>IGLU-A one man’s own house.</p>
<p>IGLU-PA (IGLU-PAK-A) his big house.</p>
<p class="iglu">IGLU-PA-LI-A the big house which he built and
still possesses.</p>
<p class="iglu">IGLU-PA-KU-LI-A the big house which he built
for himself and still possesses and which
is no longer as good as formerly.</p>
<p>There are 164 infixes for nouns and verbs in 
the Mackenzie dialect, and over one thousand 
forms can be made out for one noun alone. It is 
not surprising that Stefansson, who is one of 
about a dozen linguists familiar with this language,<a class="p" id="pVIII"></a>
regards it as the most difficult but at the same time 
the most efficient language as yet evolved by man. 
He tells me that it was only after six years of 
constant study and practice that he attained 
proficiency in its use. So at least a decade may 
be necessary before Mr. Joyce’s “word-ballet” 
yields its secret even to an adjusted mind.</p>
<p>The only serious attempt which has been made 
to deal with the way in which Mr. Joyce builds 
up his word structures is Rodker’s article in 
<i>Transition</i>, No. 14; and as he refers to the 
analyses given in the <i>Meaning of Meaning</i>, I may 
add a few remarks supplementary to what can 
there be found. For a language like that of 
Mr. Joyce, there are ten main ways in which 
symbolic texture can be complicated and compac<span class="h">-<br></span>ted.</p>
<p class="iglu_ways">Root-cultivation
Tongue-gesture
Rhyme-slang
Analogical deformation<a class="p" id="pIX"></a></p>
<p class="iglu_ways">Onomatopoeia, phonetic and kinetic 
Puns, select and dialect 
Spoonerisms
Condensations
Mergers
Echoes</p>
<p>If we separate the functions of language into
four main divisions — Sense, Feeling, Tone and 
Intention — it is clear that Mr. Joyce’s neologisms 
chiefly provide blends of the three last. He is 
not concerned, as is the scientist, with the creation 
of new names, so much as with the development 
of fresh emotive and invective gestures. In this 
respect the researches of Sir Richard Paget should 
prove germane ; and as regards the four language 
functions, the inquisitive may be referred to 
Professor I. A. Richards’ <i>Practical Criticism</i> now 
in the press, where the relevant portions of his 
<i>Principles</i> are further expanded.</p>
<p>As a result of this synthetic proliferate agglom<span class="h">-<br></span>eration whereby the timeless condensation of the<a class="p" id="pX"></a>
dream is attained, there is a natural temptation 
for the critical clinician to be reminded of the 
obscurer forms of graphomanic infantilism or 
deliriant echolalia. Here Mr. Joyce must be 
content to suffer with Blake, Cézanne and Picasso, 
with Walt Whitman, and even with Hieronymus 
Bosch. Whoever flouts, parodies, or evades linguistic 
conventions, will seem to the magistrature to have 
something in common with those whose inhibitions 
or social ties have broken down. It is worth 
noting, however, that even the musical innovations 
achieved by a reversed gramophone, in spite of 
analogies with the mirror-speech of certain asylum 
cases, have a structural and melodic significance 
for persons of understanding.</p>
<p>Mr. Joyce’s symbolic condensation, in fact, 
corresponds closely enough with his theory of 
Time — a theory incidentally responsible for the 
rattle of Lewis-guns which still resounds through 
<i>The Mookse and The Gripes</i>. The intensive, 
compressive, reverberative infixation ; the sly,<a class="p" id="pXI"></a>
meaty, oneiric logorrhoea, polymathic, polyper<span class="h">-<br></span>verse; even the clangorous calembour, irrespon<span class="h">-<br></span>sible and irrepressible, all conjure us to penetrate 
the night mind of man, that kaleidoscopic recamera 
of an hypothecated Unconscious, jolted by some 
logophilous Birth-trauma into chronic serial 
extension.</p>
<p>A little more than two centuries ago another 
Dublin satirist attempted to influence the English 
language, then threatened by neologisms due to 
the return of Charles II’s court from exile abroad. 
In his <i>Letter to the Lord Treasurer</i> Swift deplores 
the “licentiousness which from infecting our reli<span class="h">-<br></span>gion and morals fell to corrupt our language”. 
And from Swift,· too, came the <i>Tatler</i> indictment 
of the “late refinements crept into our language”—
which included ‘mob’ and the failure to pronounce 
the ‘e’ in disturbed.</p>
<p>Fifty years later Dr. Johnson triumphantly 
arrested the entire language. “ I hereby declare” 
wrote Lord Chesterfield in <i>The World</i>, “that I<!-- added quote --><a class="p" id="pXII"></a>
make a total surrender of all my rights and 
privileges in the English language, as a freeborn 
British subject, to the said Mr. Johnson, during 
the term of his Dictatorship.” And as regards 
spelling, “I have really known very fatal consequen<span class="h">-<br></span>ces attend the loose and uncertain practise of 
auricular orthography”.</p>
<p>What Chesterfield meant half in jest, the 
academic world ingested in all seriousness, and 
though the advantages which resulted from stand<span class="h">-<br></span>ardization are undoubted, a reaction is overdue 
from both the literary and commercial sufferers.</p>
<p>Yet in another mood (sair chairmanlooking, 
like the Ondt, “when he was not making spaces 
in his psyche”) when Freud and Dante, Vico and 
Earwicker, Remorse and Erse give place to a 
more Rabelaisian Parisian Joyce, the cynical 
flexibility of a portentous verbal virtuoso is 
manifest. Joyce, the protagonist of neologistic 
orthology, the bell-wether of debabelization, 
demands a different approach.<a class="p" id="pXIII"></a></p>
<p>There are two main tendencies in this most 
significant of contemporary aspirations. Chaucer, 
Elyot, Nash, Rabelais, Urquhart, and the literary 
practitioners of the last decade, are in contrast 
with a tradition which began with Bishop Wilkins 
and Leibnitz, and which led through Horne Tooke 
to the great Jeremy Bentham, even through 
Zamenhof and C. S. Peirce, to the makers of those 
latest notations and nomenclatures which are 
again revolutionizing the sciences.</p>
<p>The first may achieve the new Word-Orches<span class="h">-<br></span>tration, the second may destroy the old Word<span class="hh">-<br></span>Magic. If it is worth asking what can be done 
for Internationalism with the 500 words of 
Panoptic English, or whither a billion symbols 
will lead the groping scientist; it is equally worth 
creating new symbolic melodies on the eternal 
themes even for a dozen kindred experts in 
emotional association, with the entire parapher<span class="h">-<br></span>nalia of communicative language, from the dis<span class="h">-<br></span>cretest intra-verbal punctuation to the most<a class="p" id="pXIV"></a>
saturated polysyllabic interpenetration. If the 
reading of <i>Work in Progress</i>, and particularly 
these three apologues, does but serve to stimulate 
here and there an interest in words as sincere as 
that of their author, let us rejoice.</p>

<section><h3>THE MOOKSE AND THE GRIPES</h3><p><span>E</span>INS within a space and a weary wide space it 
wast ere wohned a Mookse. The onesome<span class="h">-<br></span>ness wast alltolonely, archunsitslike, broady oval,
and a Mookse he would a walking go (My hood ! 
cries Antony Romeo) so one grandsumer evening, 
after a great morning and his good supper of 
gammon and spittish, having flabelled his eyes, 
pilleoled his nostrils, vacticanated his ears and 
palliumed his throats, he put on his impermeable, 
seized his impugnable, harped on his crown and 
stepped out of his immobile <i>De Rure Albo</i> (socolled 
becauld it was chalkfull of masterplasters and 
had borgeously letout gardens strown with cascad<span class="h">-<br></span>as, pintacostecas, horthoducts and currycombs)<a class="p" id="p01"></a>
and set off from Ludstown a spasso to see how 
badness was badness in the weirdest of all pens<span class="h">-<br></span>ible ways. As he set off with his father’s sword, 
his <i>lancia spezzata</i>, he was girded on, and with 
that between his legs and his tarkeels, our once 
in only Bragspear, he clanked, to my clinking, 
from veetoes to threetop, every inch of an 
immortal. He had not walked over a pentiadpair 
of parsecs from his azylium when at the turning 
of the Shinshone Lanteran near Saint Bowery’s<span class="hh">-<br></span>without-his-Walls he came (secunding to the one 
one oneth of the propecies, <i>Amnis Limina Perma<span class="h">-<br></span>nent,</i>) upon the most unconsciously boggylooking 
stream he ever locked his eyes with. Out of the 
colliens it took a rise by daubing itself Ninon. It 
looked little and it smelt of brown and it thought 
in narrows and it talked showshallow. And as it 
rinn it dribbled like any lively purliteasy : <i>My, 
my, my! Me and me! Little down dream don’t I 
love thee !</i> And, I declare, what was there on the 
yonder bank of the stream that would be a river,<a class="p" id="p02"></a>
parched on a limb of the olum, bolt downright, but 
the Gripes? And no doubt he was fit to be dried for 
why had he not been having the juice of his times ?</p>
<p>His pips had been neatly all drowned on him ;

<p>— Good appetite us, sir Mookse ! How do you 
do it ? cheeped the Gripes in a wherry whiggy 
maudelenian woice and the jackasses all within 
bawl laughed and brayed for his intentions for 
they knew their sly toad lowry now. I am rarum<span class="h">-<br></span>ominum blessed to see you, my dear mouster. Will

Gather behind me, satraps ! Rot !</p>
<p>— I am till infinity obliged with you, bowed 
the Gripes, his whine having gone to his palpruy 
head. I am still always having a wish on all my 
extremities. By the watch, what is the time, 
pace?</p>
<p>Figure it! The pining peever ! To a Mookse !</p>
<p>— Ask my index, mund my achilles, swell 
my obolum, woshup my nase serene, answered 
the Mookse, rapidly by turning clement, urban, 
eugenious and celestian in the formose of good 
grogory humours. Quote awhore ? That is quite

<p><i>Sancta Patientia</i>. You should have heard the

<p>— I was just thinkling upon that, swees 
Mookse, but, for all the rime on my raisins, if I 
connow make my submission, I cannos give you 
up, the Gripes whimpered from nethermost of his 
wanhope. Ishallassoboundbewilsothoutoosezit. My

<p>Nuvoletta in her lightdress, spunn of sisteen
shimmers was looking down on them, leaning over 
the bannistars and listening all she childishly could. 
How she was brightened when Shouldrups in 
his glaubering hochskied his welkinstuck and how 
she was overclused when Kneesknobs on his 
zwivvel was makeacting such a paulse of himshelp ! 
She was alone. All her nubied companions were 
asleeping with the squirrels. Their mivver, Mrs 
Moonan, was off in the Fuerst quarter scrubbing 
the backsteps of Number 28. Fuvver, that Skand,<a class="p" id="p11"></a>
he was up in Norwood’s sokaparlour, eating 
oceans of Voking’s Blemish. Nuvoletta listened 
as she reflected herself, though the heavenly one 
with his constellatria and his emanations stood 
between, and she tried all she tried to make the 
Mookse look up at her (but <i>he</i> was fore too adiapt<span class="h">-<br></span>otously farseeing) and to make the Gripes hear 
how coy she could be (though he was much too 
schystimatically auricular about <i>his ens</i> to heed 
her) but it was all mild’s vapour moist. Not even 
her feignt reflection, Nuvoluccia, could they 
toke their gnoses off for their minds with intrepi<span class="h">-<br></span>fide fate and bungless curiasity, were conclaved 
with Heliogobbleus and Commodus and Enobarb<span class="h">-<br></span>arus and whatever the coordinal dickens they 
did as their damprauch of papyrs and buchstubs 
said. As if that was their spiration ! As if theirs 
could duiparate her queendim ! As if she would 
be third perty to search on search proceedings ! 
She tried all the winsome wonsome ways her 
four winds had taught her. She tossed her<a class="p" id="p12"></a>
sfumastelliacinous hair like <i>la princesse de la Petite 
Bretagne</i> and she rounded her mignons arms like 
Mrs Cornwallis-West and she smiled over herself 
like the beauty of the image of the pose of the 
daughter of the queen of the Emperour of Irelande 
and she sighed after herself as were she born to 
bride with Tristis Tristior Tristissimus. But, sweet 
madonine, she might fair as well have carried her 
daisy’s worth to Florida. For the Mookse, a 
dogmad Accanite, were not amoosed and the 
Gripes, a dubliboused Catalick, wis pinefully 
obliviscent. I see, she sighed. There are menner.</p>
<p>The siss of the whisp of the sigh of the soft<span class="h">-<br></span>zing at the stir of the ver grose O arundo of a 
long one in midias reeds : and shades began to 
glidder along the banks, greepsing, greepsing, 
duusk unto duusk, and it was as glooming as 
gloaming could be in the waste of all peacable 
worlds. Metamnisia was allsoonome coloroform 
brune ; citherior spiane an eaulande, innemorous 
and unnumerose. The Mookse had a sound eyes<a class="p" id="p13"></a>
right but he could not all hear. The Gripes had 
light ears left yet he could but ill see. He ceased. 
And he ceased, tung and trit, and it was neverso<span class="h">-<br></span>ever so dusk of both of them. But still Moo thought 
on the deeps of the undths he would profoundth 
come the morrokse and still Gri feeled of the 
scripes he would escipe if by grice he had luck 
enoupes.</p>
<p>O, how it was duusk ! From Vallee Maraia to 
grasyaplaina, dormimust Echo ! Ah dew! Ah dew ! 
It was so duusk that the tears of night began to 
fall, first by ones and twos, then by threes and 
fours, at last by fives and sixes of sevens, for the 
tired ones were wecking, as we weep now with 
them. <i>O! O! O! Par la pluie!</i></p>
<p>Then there came down to the thither bank a 
woman of no appearance (I believe she was a 
Black with chills at her feet) and she gathered up 
his hoariness the Mookse motamourfully where 
he was spread and caried him away to her 
invisible dwelling, thats hights, <i>Aquila Rapax</i>, for<a class="p" id="p14"></a>
he was the holy sacred solem and poshup spit 
of her bushop’s apron. So you see the Mookse 
he had reason as I knew and you knew and he 
knew all along. And there came down to the 
hither bank a woman to all important (though 
they say that she was comely, spite the cold in 
her heed) and, for he was as like it as blow it to 
a hawker’s hank, she plucked down the Gripes, 
torn panicky autotone, in angeu from his limb 
and cariad away its beotitubes with her to her 
unseen shieling, it is, <i>De Rore Coeli</i>. And so the
poor Gripes got wrong ; for that is always how a 
Gripes is, always was and always will be. And 
it was never so thoughtful of either of them. 
And there were left now an only elmtree and 
but a stone. Polled with pietrous, Sierre but saule. 
O ! Yes! And Nuvoletta, a lass.</p>
<p>Then Nuvoletta reflected for the last time in 
her little long life and she made up all her 
myriads of drifting minds in one. She cancelled 
all her engauzements. She climbed over the<a class="p" id="p15"></a>
bannistars; she gave a childy cloudy cry: <i>Nuée ! 
Nuée!</i> A lightdress fluttered. She was gone. 
And into the river that had been a stream (for 
a thousand of tears had gone eon her and 
come on her and she was stout and struck on 
dancing and her muddied name was Missisliffi) 
there fell a tear, a singult tear, the loveliest of 
all tears (I mean for those who are “ keen ” on 
the pretty-pretty commonface sort of thing you 
meet by hopeharrods) for it was a leaptear. 
But the river tripped on her by and by, lapping 
as though her heart was brook : <i>Why, why, why! 
Weh, O weh ! I’se so silly to be flowing but I no 
canna stay!</i></p><a class="p" id="p16"></a>

<p>He had eaten all the whilepaper, swallowed the 
lustres, devoured forty flights of styearcases, 
chewed up all the mensas and seccles, ronged the

neutriment for a chittinous chip so mitey. But when 
Chrysalmas was on the bare branches off he went 
from Tingsomingenting. He took a round stroll 
and he took a stroll round and he took a round 
strollagain till the grillies in his head and the 
leivnits in his hair made him thought he had the 
Tossmania. Had he twicylched the sees of the 
deed and trestraversed their revermer? Was he 
come to hevre with his engiles or gone to hull 
with the poop? The June snows was flocking in 
thuckflues on the hegelstomes, millipeeds of it and 
myriopoods, and a lugly tournedos, the Borabora<span class="h">-<br></span>yellers blohablasting tegolhuts up to tetties and

boundlessly blissfilled in an allallahbath of

crabround and marypose, chasing Floh out of 
charity and tickling Luse, I hope too, and tackling 
Bienie, faith, as well, and jucking Vespatilla jukely
